# DOM Standard

This is the repository in which the W3C's DOM Specification is maintained.

# Plan for DOM 4.1

The [W3C Web Platform WG](https://www.w3.org/2016/11/webplatform-charter.html) is chartered to update the DOM specification.

The highest priority is [issues](https://github.com/w3c/dom/issues) that are clearly undecided. All inputs are welcome.  

## How this works

The `dom4.1` branch maintains the Bikeshed source document. The `gh-pages`
branch contains a snapshot as `index.html`. Historical files are still available in the `dom4` branch.
