# DOM Standard

[DOM4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-dom-20151119/) was published as a W3C Recommendation on 19 November 2015.

## How this works

The `master` branch tracks the upstream repository, no local changes are made to it. The `gh-pages`
branch contains merges from `master`, tools to produce the snapshot, and the snapshot itself as
`index.html`.

Where needed, feature branches are used in order to make pull requests against the upstream repository.
