# DOM Standard

This is the repository in which the W3C snapshot version of the DOM Standard is maintained.

If you wish to file issues or provide pull requests for new features, you are also encouraged to look at the
[upstream repository](https://github.com/whatwg/dom).

# Plan for DOM 4.1

The [W3C Web Platform WG](https://www.w3.org/2016/11/webplatform-charter.html) is chartered to update the DOM specification.

The highest priority is issues that are clearly undecided. All inputs are welcome.  

## How this works

The `dom4.1` branch maintains the Bikeshed source document. The `gh-pages`
branch contains a snapshot as `index.html`. Historical files are still available in `dom4` branch.
