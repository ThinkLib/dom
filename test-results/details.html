        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Historically, W3C test suites have altogether too often been subpar in their coverage,
          barely scraping the surface of interoperability. In such a context, with only a few 
          hundred simple tests, it is naturally expected that one would expect to hit the 100%
          pass mark.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the more recent focus on testing however, notably through the
          <a href='https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/'>Web Platform Tests</a> and
          <a href='http://testthewebforward.org/'>Test The Web Forward</a> projects the quality
          of test suites has improved massively. And since we don't live in a perfect world, if one
          looks for trouble hard enough one will find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM test suite, which is now 47,000 tests strong (and growing), certainly did set out
          to look for trouble. Given that, it seems useful to accompany the test results with this
          this note explaining where the failures come from.
        </p>
        <p>
          In total, 1719 tests fail to pass in two implementations, which amounts to 3.65% of the
          total. The sections below provide context in which to appraise these failures.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Failures from <code>Range.compareBoundaryPoints()</code></h2>
        <p>
          A full 1177 of the 1719 (68.5%) come from a single test file. This test file generates
          8000 tests by going through a list of ranges that need comparing under a wide array of
          configurations. These failures break down into two large blocks:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Problematic use of <code>detach()</code></dt>
          <dd>
            The <code>detach()</code> method was used in the test, but it has since become 
            deprecated (or rather, it is defined to do nothing). A fix is making its way through the
            test suite process.
          </dd>
          <dt>Validation of the first argument</dt>
          <dd>
            Many tests check that the first argument, which is an enumeration of 
            <code>short</code>s, produces the correct error when something else is provided. 
            For these tests, several browsers fail by throwing an error of the wrong type
            (which boils down to issues they have with the WebIDL algorithm for conversions to
            numbers). This is of particularly low importance in JavaScript since the 
            <code>catch</code> clause of a <code>try</code> cannot switch on exception type. So
            getting an exception in the first place (which is happening) is vitally more important
            than getting an exception of the right type.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          Ten other files are seeing the same <code>detach()</code> bug (fix in progress), 
          accounting for a further 133 failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faulty tests and WebIDL argument conversion failures leading to exceptions of the wrong
          type do not point at any interoperability issue of concern. Eliminating these results
          leaves us with 379 failures (0.80% of total).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>WebIDL related issues</h2>
        <p>
          Thirteen of the test files exhibit various degrees of WebIDL-related problems, for a total
          of 329 tests. These are largely in the <code>interfaces.html</code> tests which are
          auto-generated WebIDL conformance tests. In many cases, if just one bug were fixed the
          number of failures would fall dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failures in other files are usually either conversion errors (e.g. failing to convert
          <code>undefined</code> to the empty string) or exception type errors.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of these failures are particularly important and actual in-the-trenches 
          interoperability only suffers ever so lightly from these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eliminating these leaves us with 50 failures (0.10%).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Event failures</h2>
        <p>
          Four files, with a total of 31 failures, concern Events. Two of those are for Progress
          Events which are defined in a separate specification (they will be moved). The rest is
          essentially issues with default values being applied properly to synthetically created
          events. While these issues would possibly cause interoperability bugs in real code, they
          do not demonstrate implementatibility problems and we are confident that they will get
          fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leaves us with 19 failures (0.04%).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>
          What remains is a hodgepodge of small corner case problems. A number of the failures are
          due to checks that old, now obsolete, DOM features (e.g. <code>CDATASection</code>) are
          indeed gone; but it is not a normative requirement of the specification that they be
          actually removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few more have to do with stringification of some attributes, and obscure failures from
          the diminishing returns corner.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Considering that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the volume of failures is low to start with;</li>
          <li>
            the vast majority come from single sources that do not pose major threats to 
            interoperability;
          </li>
          <li>
            the percentage of issues that point to problems that could affect developers is
            so vanishingly small as to be negligible;
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We contend that the specification being proposed for advancement through the process has
          demonstrated interoperability.
